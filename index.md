I'm a PhD student at ETH ZÃ¼rich working causal network structures in machine learning. Before my PhD, I studied physics at the University of Freiburg, Imperial College London and University of Oxford.

Main research interest: *Statistics and machine learning* (causality, Bayesian networks, inference, missing data); *Interdisciplinary applications* (genomics, cancer, personalized medicine)
