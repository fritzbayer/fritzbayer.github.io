I'm a PhD student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) working causal network structures in machine learning. Before my PhD, I studied physics at the [University of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) and [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk).

Main research interest: *Machine learning and statistics* (causality, Bayesian networks, inference, missing data); *Interdisciplinary applications* (genomics, cancer, personalized medicine)
