## Beaty in complexity

## The Art of Osciallations

This is a small collaborative project together with [Matif Klang](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5xHfRNTnaVVOYHrhLvjhmx?si=VJ9V2dWCSJS7G5R8puN4yQ), whom you can hear playing the saxophone in the short clip. 

Oscillation is the repetitive variation of a measure about a point of equilibrium. Oscillations in magnetic fields are used to acquire images of human tissue in magnectic resonance imaging and lead to acoustic signals in our instruments. The idea of this project was to create a visalization of oscillations to emphasize their role in the acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging, as well as in the creation of music.

I plan on adding a bit of code and equations in the future.
